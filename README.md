In this project I used the DOM Manipulation techniques that I learned in the previous lessons, also learning more about the DOM while researching to find the solutions to the problems that I faced.

The project was enjoyable. It was neither easy nor hard, just a little above my skill level which made the challenges very fun to solve.

The only thing that I'm not satisfied with is the fact that the mouse starts coloring the blocks from the second block in its path, leaving the first block uncolored. I think this is a problem caused by the suboptimal choices of mouse events to track, but I can't fix the problem right now. Hopefully I will learn the solution to this problem later in the curriculum for my next projects.
